## Add a CODEOWNERS file to the repository

CODEOWNERS file defines the people who are the owers of the code in the repository. To add a CODEOWNERS file to a repository, create a file with the name CODEOWNERS in the root, `docs/` or `.github/` directory of the repository. According to GitHub docs,

> Each CODEOWNERS file assigns the code owners for a single branch in the repository. Thus, you can assign different code owners for different branches, such as @octo-org/codeowners-team for a code base on the default branch and @octocat for a GitHub Pages site on the gh-pages branch.
